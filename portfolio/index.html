              <p>
                Hi, I’m Chase. I am a full-stack web developer with a particular
                interest in front-end development. My specialties include HTML,
                CSS, Javascript, React and Node.
              </p>
              <p>
                ***To view my latest projects, please scroll down to the
                Portfolio section.***
              </p>
              <p>
                After 6 years in the specialty coffee industry, I’ve developed
                strong creative problem-solving, organizational, and
                communication skills. My time as a head roaster has taught me
                how to self-motivate, continuously improving the end product
                through careful observation of data as well as the value of
                being in charge of a pivotal part of a small business. Working
                in the service industry has given me valuable insight into
                customer interactions and hospitality. I aim to take those
                insights and my skills from my years as a head roaster and
                translate them into polished and cutting-edge applications that
                are seamless and easy to use. When I'm not programming, you can
                find me rock climbing, walking my corgi, reading a book or
                trying a new recipe for my wife and I.

              Below are a handful of the projects I have built on my journey of
              web-development.

                <h3 class="major">Save The Animals Webpage</h3>
                <p>
                  I built this website from scratch using HTML and CSS(LESS) for
                  a Build Week Project while at Lambda school. It is meant to
                  advertise and explain the Save The Animals application that
                  another portion of our team built. It is a fully responsive
                  and multi-page website.

                <p>
                  This project was built using React.js. It is a To-Do list
                  application that allows you to add tasks, select said tasks
                  when they are complete and delete them from the application. I
                  styled this React application using styled-components and I
                  used stateful class components, with a reducer hook to build
                  the functionality.

                <h3 class="major">Weight Lifting Journal</h3>
                <p>
                  This project was for another Build Week at Lambda School. A
                  team of fellow students and I built this journal for weight
                  lifting. The journal allows you to register and sign in with
                  with a server built by another student. Once you are logged in
                  the application will allow you to view a protected page which
                  you can use to make a workout note. As a user you can edit or
                  delete the workout as well as add specific exercises for each
                  workout you create. My contribution to the product was setting
                  up the architecture and connecting all of the components to
                  the Context API which was used for state management. I also
                  developed all of the CRUD (create, retrieve, update and
                  delete) operations for the application.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This application was built using React.js. It fetches some
                  data from NASA Astronomy Photo Of The Day API and displays the
                  photo of the day and some detailed information about the
                  astronomy photo. The application was styled using
                  styled-components.
